Experiment 62
This was run as part of a gridsearch endeavor to see if any combination of the searched parameters would give good results for latent space 100.
For this run the parameters were as follows:
learning_rate = 1e-3
kl_loss_mult = 1e-6
kl_extra_mult = 1
kl_extra_exponent = 4
use_square = True
data_source = ["chello"]

Loss | Reconstruction | KL | Completion | Epochs | Elapsed | Remaining | Speed
20000.0015 | 0.0011 | 2000000000000.0000 | 100% | 100/100 | 33:39 | 00:00 | 20.19s/it
