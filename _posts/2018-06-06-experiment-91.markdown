Experiment 91
This was run as part of a gridsearch endeavor to see if any combination of the searched parameters would give good results for latent space 100.
For this run the parameters were as follows:
learning_rate = 1e-3
kl_loss_mult = 5e-4
kl_extra_mult = 2
kl_extra_exponent = 4
use_square = False
data_source = ["chello"]

Loss | Reconstruction | KL | Completion | Epochs | Elapsed | Remaining | Speed
0.0008 | 0.0004 | 74.8616 | 100% | 100/100 | 34:53 | 00:00 | 20.94s/it
