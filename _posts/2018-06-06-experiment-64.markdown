Experiment 64
This was run as part of a gridsearch endeavor to see if any combination of the searched parameters would give good results for latent space 100.
For this run the parameters were as follows:
learning_rate = 1e-3
kl_loss_mult = 1e-6
kl_extra_mult = 3
kl_extra_exponent = 2
use_square = True
data_source = ["chello"]

Loss | Reconstruction | KL | Completion | Epochs | Elapsed | Remaining | Speed
0.0001 | 0.0001 | 5235.2163 | 100% | 100/100 | 33:37 | 00:00 | 20.17s/it
