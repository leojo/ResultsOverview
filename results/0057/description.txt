This was run as part of a gridsearch endeavor to see if any combination of the searched parameters would give good results for latent space 100.
For this run the parameters were as follows:
learning_rate = 1e-3
kl_loss_mult = 1e-6
kl_extra_mult = 2
kl_extra_exponent = 4
use_square = False
data_source = ["chello"]
